## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using a real-world dataset focused on Random Forest Regression. It is designed as an educational resource to help understand data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Repository Structure

- **CSE-Pathsala-ML-Project/**
    - **Data/** — Folder containing raw and processed datasets  
      (CSV or other data files go here)
    - **EDA.ipynb** — Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis
    - **Feature_Engineering_and_Model_Training.ipynb** — Notebook for feature engineering & model training
    - **README.md** — Project documentation and overview
  
## Data Description

All datasets used are located in the `Data/` folder. The `EDA.ipynb` notebook provides a detailed look at the data, including:

- Data schema and feature descriptions
- Missing values and data quality checks
- Visualizations of the data distributions and relationships

## Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Performed in `EDA.ipynb`.
- Involves loading data, cleaning, plotting insights, and preparing a data summary.

### 2. Feature Engineering & Model Training

- Carried out in `Feature_engineering and model training.ipynb`.
- Covers data preprocessing, feature selection/creation.
- Implements model building with Random Forest Regression.
- Uses hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV or other methods.
- Evaluates models based on relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²).
- Saves final model and parameters for deployment or further use.

## How to Run

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

2. Open and run the notebooks in this order:
1. `EDA.ipynb`
2. `Feature_engineering and model training.ipynb`

Follow comments in the notebooks for detailed usage and explanations.

## Results & Discussion

- Model evaluation and comparisons are presented in the training notebook.
- Visual plots, score metrics, and observations help you assess model quality and tuning effectiveness.
